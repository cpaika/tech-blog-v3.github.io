Recently I tried out the [helix editor](https://helix-editor.com/) primarily because I've enjoyed neovim but found the lua plugin system annoying, and helix is written in Rust (my favorite language).

What's strange is that through fits and starts I'm really starting to like it. 

There's some downsides - it doesn't have a plugin system, to make one work I had to build a feature branch from source and edit their plugin system to be more robust.

But I love the user-friendliness of it.  The way you can type `g` and a menu of commands pops up. It's very pleasant.

And there's something about the vim keybindings that just feel good for your brain. I wouldn't say I'm good at them - and at times learning them can be frustrating.  But something about moving around in terminal feels better than the friction of a mouse. Just frustrating to fight 20 years of muscle memory to reach for the mouse.

So after vim, then neovim, then emacs, I'm back to another text editor.  Maybe this one will stick. It likely won't :)  But I'll sure have fun learning it.
