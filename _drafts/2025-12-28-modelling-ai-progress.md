Everyone loves predicting the future of AI, myself included. This post will be an attempt to predict the future of AI progress, from the perspective of December 2025.  Likely much will be incorrect, but I believe the act of doing specific predictions allows you to clarify your understanding and thinking, even if you are most likely wrong. This exercise has been done by many people, however I want to do it myself to build a mental model and intuition of the important variables in the space. 

Systems modelling is an excellent way to understand complex systems like the modern economy -  Donella Meadows book [Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557) was a huge influence on how I view the world.

## What are the major concepts?
