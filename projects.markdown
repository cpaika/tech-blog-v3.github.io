#### MNIST Neural Network Visualizer (2025)
A WebAssembly-powered interactive visualization of a neural network learning to recognize handwritten digits. Built with Rust and WebGPU for high-performance training in the browser. [Click here to try it out](/assets/mnist-visualizer/index.html)

#### WASM LLM Training Visualizer (2025)
Train a small language model, in the browser from scratch! [Click here to try it out](/assets/lm-visualizer/index.html).

Built on top of the MNIST trainer above.

#### Learning Category Theory and Scala (2023)
For my job at Tesla Energy I spent a lot of time understanding and mastering the Scala language, as well as general functional patterns.

I worked through two books on Scala and Functional Programming:

The first is Category Theory For Programmers by Bartosz Milewski. It's a great book and increased my ability to write good functional Scala.

The other is Functional Programming Simplified, by Alvin Alexander.  It's a lot more basic than the book on Category theory, so was great to help me master the fundamentals while I stretched my abilities with the book on Category Theory.

#### Gravity Game (2020)
A little game I used to try out webpack. Add planets to the field and watch them all interact with each other gravitationally. [Click here to try it out](https://cpaika.github.io/gravity-game/)

# Current Projects 🌱
#### Writing
I've always enjoyed blogging here, as well as writing on twitter.  I'm slowly working on a personal book, about myself for an audience of one.

# Abandoned Projects 🧟
#### Learning Golang
*Status: No reason to learn Golang - I'm learning Scala for work!*

To stay up to date with the industry and contribute in the [Cloud Native Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) open source ecosystem, I've started to learn the Go programming language.
To start I picked up a (physical!) copy of the highly recommend ["The Go Programming Language"](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440)


![A picture of my copy of The Go Programming Language](/assets/projects/golang-book.jpg)

Currently I'm going through the exercises, chapter by chapter.  You can see my progress through the exercises [on my github repo](https://github.com/cpaika/the-go-programming-language)

#### Calendar Calculator
*Status: Would love to come back to this someday!*

A golang utility that reads your google calendar and lets you know how many meetings you've had over different periods of time.
